     <article>
       <h1 style="font-size:1.2vw"> Ry큰nosuke Tanaka is a second year in Karasuno High and is Karasunos #5 playing as a wing spiker and is an up-and-coming ace. </h1>
       <h1 style="font-size:1.2vw"> Tanaka is loud, hot-headed and short tempered, and can be somewhat considered as a slacker as its evident by his work ethic in school and being late to practices. Despite his argumentative self, he is very caring and supportive of his teammates. </h1>
       <h1 style="font-size:1.2vw"> His work ethic may be poor when it comes to school but on court he is unstoppable and uncontrollably loud. Both physically and mentally tough as he tends to be a vital scorer on Karasuno but also often finds himself being targeted by the other team. However, his mental toughness/fortitude is above most not letting it get the better of him. </h1>
