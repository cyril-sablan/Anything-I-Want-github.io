     <article>
       <h1 style="font-size:1.2vw">Daichi is a third year attending Karasuno and Karasunos #1 playing as both the captain and a wing spiker. </h1>
       <h1 style="font-size:1.2vw">Daichi is very caring, responsible and selfless captain being both very patient and understanding. Despite this he is very strict with his teammates when they act out and is considered very terrifying when angry though he rarely shows this side of behavior. </h1>
       <h1 style="font-size:1.2vw">Due to his devotion towards his team he is well respected and admired by the team.  </h1>
       <h1 style="font-size:1.2vw"> Daichi isn't particularly exceptional at a particular category in volleyball but is extremely reliable as he has all the basics well refined and overall a well balanced player especially when it comes to receiving and boosting team moral. </h1>
