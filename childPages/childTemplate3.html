     <article>
        <h1 style="font-size:1.2vw">Yū Nishinoya is a second year in Karasuno and is Karasuos #4 playing as the liberio referred to as "Karasuno's Guardian Deity" as he displays remarkable skills. Yū Nishinoya came from a prestigious middle school volleyball team like Kageyama from Chidoriyama Junior High. </h1>
        <h1 style="font-size:1.2vw">Yū Nishinoya much like Hinata is short in size but has incredible skills particularly in receiving the ball. He has a quirky habit of spontaneously creating ridiculous names for crazy moves he executes both in practice and in matches. </h1>
        <h1 style="font-size:1.2vw">Nishinoya tends to be impatient and impulsive but is very energetic and boisterous nature/attitude. However, in a match he drastically changes in becoming incredibly focused and serious while remaining calm and collected. </h1>
        <h1 style="font-size:1.2vw">Nishinoya  is great with communication and is loved and admired by the whole team. He loves challenging himself and facing strong teams as he likes to constantly improve in his ability. </h1>
