     <article>
      <h1 style="font-size:1.2vw"> Tobio Kageyama is a first-year student attending Karasuno High and is Karasunos #9 playing as the setter position and one half of the freak quick duo. </h1>
      <h1 style="font-size:1.2vw"> Ever since his time in one of the best middle school volleyball teams in his prefecture (Kitawaga First), Kageyama was considered "The King of the Court" but not a good kind of king, one who was a dictator who was very demanding and arrogant. He had habits of disregarding and condescending towards his teammates. </h1>
      <h1 style="font-size:1.2vw"> He was also referred to as a prodigy and young genius as he had much skill to back up his arrogance but lacked communication and teamwork with his oppressively and egocentric attitude. But upon arrival in Karasuno, he has grown to be more respectful and accepting of his teammates abilities and opinions and more understanding overall in teamwork. </h1>
      <h1 style="font-size:1.2vw"> Kageyama had shown much promise he was invited to the All-Japan Youth which consists of the best of the best under 18 volleyball players. </h1>
